# Chaos Control — Smart Scheduler v4 (Static)

A beautifully unhinged productivity app with flexible scheduling, pinned days, Alberta holiday awareness, search, export/import, recurring tasks, and a gold-star reward when you finish the day. Built to help dysfunctional adults manage total chaos (with style).

## How to update
1. Replace `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, `404.html`, `bomb-muted.svg`, and (optionally) `ding.mp3`.
2. Commit to the `main` branch. GitHub Pages serves the files instantly (no Actions needed).

## Data
Your tasks and preferences are stored in **localStorage** in the browser. Export/Import lives in the header.
